# PDF to txt (Python)

## Description
This code shows how to use py2PDF. Quite simple as all I wanted was to generate a txt with a single page PDF. The code goes as follows:

1) libraries installation, imports, etc.
2) Definition of local variables
3) Text definition

## How to install this
1) Download the code
2) Make sure that you installed:
* py2PDF (https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/convert-pdf-to-txt)
Note: take into account that several features were deprecated in the link's example so I had to update several of them.
